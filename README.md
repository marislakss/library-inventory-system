It defines the properties and methods associated with a book object. The properties include id, name, genre, price, quantity, publish, printed, and isbnNumber. The class provides getter and setter methods for each property, allowing access and modification of the book's information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [InventoryTableModel.java](https://github.com/marislakss/library-inventory-system/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/demo/InventoryTableModel.java)       | The code above defines the InventoryTableModel class, which extends the AbstractTableModel class. This class is used for displaying the inventory of books in a JTable component. It contains a list of books as its data and implements various methods to interact with the table, such as retrieving column names, retrieving and setting cell values, and determining cell editability. It uses an enum to define the column names and indices for easy reference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [RegistrationForm.java](https://github.com/marislakss/library-inventory-system/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/demo/RegistrationForm.java)             | The code above is a Java program that implements a registration form GUI (Graphical User Interface). It allows users to input their information such as username, password, first name, last name, contact number, email, and security question. The program then checks if the entered username is already taken by reading user records from a text file called "users.txt". If the username is available, a new user record is created and appended to the file. If the username is already taken, an error message is displayed. The program also includes a cancel button that clears the input fields and closes the registration form window. The core functionality revolves around validating usernames, saving user records, and displaying messages to the user. |
| [LoginWindow.java](https://github.com/marislakss/library-inventory-system/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/demo/LoginWindow.java)                       | A Swing-based interface class for user authentication, providing login, registration, and password reset functionality within the Library Inventory System.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

It includes a constructor to initialize these variables and getter/setter methods for accessing and modifying the variables. The encapsulation principle is utilized to hide the object's internal state and expose only necessary information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [ResetPasswordForm.java](https://github.com/marislakss/library-inventory-system/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/demo/ResetPasswordForm.java)           | The code represents a GUI form for resetting a user's password. It allows the user to enter their username, old password, new password, and security question. Upon clicking the "Reset Password" button, the code validates the user's information against a text file ("users.txt") containing user data. If the information matches, the code updates the user's password in the text file. If not, an error message is displayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [InventoryManagementGUI.java](https://github.com/marislakss/library-inventory-system/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/demo/InventoryManagementGUI.java) | The code above defines a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for an inventory management system. It includes UI components such as text fields, combo boxes, and a table. The GUI allows users to add, update, and remove books from the inventory. It also provides functionality to display the inventory in a table format and performs validations on user inputs. The code utilizes constants for genres, fonts, colors, column names, and error/success messages. It also logs events using a logger object. The inventory is stored in an ArrayList<Book> and is initially populated with two books.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [LookAndFeelUtil.java](https://github.com/marislakss/library-inventory-system/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/demo/LookAndFeelUtil.java)               | The code is a utility class called "LookAndFeelUtil" which provides methods to configure the LookAndFeel of the application. It has a private constructor to prevent instantiation, and a "setLookAndFeel" method that sets the LookAndFeel of the application to Nimbus, if available. The code uses the Logger class for logging any errors that occur while setting the LookAndFeel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [hello-view.fxml](https://github.com/marislakss/library-inventory-system/blob/main/src/main/resources/com/example/demo/hello-view.fxml)                    | The code snippet is an XML file that represents the layout for a JavaFX application view. It includes a VBox container with a Label and a Button. The VBox is centered and has a spacing of 20. The Label has an ID of "welcomeText" and the Button has a text of "Hello!" with an event handler for the "onHelloButtonClick" action. The XML also specifies padding for the VBox. This code is likely part of a larger JavaFX application for displaying a welcome screen with a button.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
